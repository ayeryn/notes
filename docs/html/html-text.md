# HTML Text Basics

## Headings

By default, browsers style `<h1>` the largest, `<h2>` slightly smaller, with each subsequent heading level being smaller by default.

Browsers by default also decrement the `<h1>` font size based on how many `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, or `<section>` elements it is nested in.
