# Logarithms

## What is log?
The **exponent** or **power** to which a base must be raised to yield a given number. Mathematically -    
<code>
x is the logarithm of n to the base b if b<sup>x</sup> = n

e.g.,     
2<sup>3</sup> = 8 => log<sub>2</sub>8 = 3
</code>


**In CS, the base of `log` is always 2.**
